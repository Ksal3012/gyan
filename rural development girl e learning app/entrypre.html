        His journey from a small-town boy to an NIT Nagpur and IIM Bangalore alumna was a rollercoaster.</p><p> So, when we became parents, Praful was determined to give all the fatherly love and care to Ridhaan, which he missed out on as a kid.
        While I looked after Ridhaan's diet, Praful searched for ways to keep Ridhaan engaged throughout the day. A book that truly inspired us to move away from electronics and plastics and buy open-ended wooden toys for our son was "The Montessori Toddler."</p><p> That's how our second baby was born‚ÄîNESTA TOYS. 
        Nesta means pure, and that is what we want childhood to be: pure fun! NESTA TOYS was started with the hope of providing eco-friendly, natural, open-ended toys to every child in India.

        <p>Lakhpati Didi Journey

After her husband‚Äôs tragic accident, she found herself struggling to support her young daughter and herself. With no financial reserves and the burden of sudden responsibility, she returned to her maternal family, feeling the strain of dependency.</p>
<p>
She had joined a Self Help Group and was engaged in various small-scale farming activities, but the income was meager. Everything changed, when she attended a training on vermi-compost production technology. This training, conducted by Nalbari KVK, opened a new avenue for her. She started her vermi-compost production using organic waste and cow dung available at her home. She constructed low-cost tanks with local materials and received initial support from the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), which included earthworms for starting the production, and the District Agriculture Office provided her with four vermi-beds.
</p><p>
Her enterprise grew quickly; from producing 17 quintals of vermi-compost and earning Rs. 16,300 in her first year, she escalated her production significantly. She sold 150 quintals of vermi-compost. Her product, branded as ‚ÄòJay Vermi Compost‚Äô is now sold in multiple districts and has garnered recognition, leading to her being a celebrated entrepreneur in Assam. Her monthly income is around 12,000/-.
